          <p>
            I decided to go with "pure" React without Next, as I never worked with Next professionally, only on some
            tiny projects long time ago. Since I'm leaving on vacation in few days and I wanted to send it to you before
            it, I did not want to rush learning Next and rather used only what I am familiar with - pure React.

                  In the <code>datasets</code> folder you can find your data as <code>.csv</code>. I wrote a parser to
                  get it as JSON. Feel free to change the values in the <code>datasets</code> and run{" "}
                  <code>yarn dev</code>, you'll see your new values in the app locally.

                  The data are served from the <code>/public</code> folder. I am fetching them from there, which is
                  supposed to mimic back-end - a REST API with GET requests.

                  I did not use any graph library in a long time so I had to choose one. I had a great experience with
                  Ant.design few years ago and wanted to try out their graph library but did not have a chance, until
                  now. It worked fine, just the documentation was a big issue, since it was not very clear and part of
                  it was only in Chinese, which I do not speak and Google Translate is still far from perfect.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Sunburst chart doesn't support Legend component for filtering, so I had to create a custom one
                </li>

            <li>Responsive design (right now the app supports only PC with "normal" size screens)</li>
            <li>Automated tests</li>
            <li>Improve styling of this page and the design overall</li>

          <div>
            Overall, I treated this more like as a fun side project, not as a production ready app. By that I mean I
            used a less known graph library (and did not care of its' longevity) and did not spend time on implementing
            screen-size responsivity, which is in general just time consuming but not that hard to do (at least, in my
            opinion).
